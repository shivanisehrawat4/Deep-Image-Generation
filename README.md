**Project Overview:**

The Deep Image Generation with Text-Based Prompts project is a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual prompts. This project provides a versatile and creative environment for image generation, including options for generating images from prompts, creating high-quality enhanced images, and generating similar images from existing ones.

**Scripts:**

1. [Text_to_Image.py](Text_to_Image.py):
   - This script generates images from text prompts using state-of-the-art deep learning models, including CLIP, UNet, and Diffusers.

2. [Text_to_Image_Enhanced.py](Text_to_Image_Enhanced.py):
   - Building upon the capabilities of the previous script, this enhanced version generates high-quality images using an extended tech stack, creating even more visually stunning results.

3. [TTI_Similar_Images.py](TTI_Similar_Images.py):
   - This script generates similar images based on an existing image, allowing for creative variations and artistic exploration.
  
**Output Images:**

The project includes various generated images:
- `generated_image_0.jpg`, `generated_image_1.jpg`, and `generated_image_2.jpg`: These are the images generated using the Text_to_Image.py script. They showcase the results of image generation from text prompts.

- `picture_0.jpg`, `picture_1.jpg`, and `picture_2.jpg`: Similar to the generated images, these are outputs from the Text_to_Image_Enhanced.py script, each representing unique visual interpretations of text prompts.

- `similar_image.png`: This image is generated by the TTI_Similar_Images.py script and showcases a similar image to the provided input image (skyline.png).

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Deep-Image-Generation.git
   cd Deep-Image-Generation

2. Explore the Scripts: Utilize the provided Python scripts as per your needs, following the instructions within the scripts.

3. View the Generated Images: Explore the generated images, both from text prompts and the enhanced versions, as well as similar images, directly in the project directory.
